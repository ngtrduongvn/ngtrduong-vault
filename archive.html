                we played Minecraft almost every single day.
                I still remember my cousin - under the name "Bopp108" - swinging his first wooden axe to craft a table in the snowy forest.
                He taught me how to make tools, cook food, and even little tricks to survive the night.
                Every afternoon after school, I couldn't wait to open my phone and see him online.
                When we built our first house together, it felt like the whole world was ours.
                Everything was so simple and beautiful - just blocks, the wind through the trees, and the endless joy of two brothers sharing that world.

            <li>
                That year, I was only 7 when my cousin introduced me to a game called Minecraft.
                I played it on a phone, and everything felt so strange - the weird square blocks, the deep sounds that echoed every time I touched the screen.
                I wandered through that world without knowing what to do, not understanding why it turned dark or why those creatures kept attacking me.
                Gradually, my cousin began teaching me how to play - how to break and place blocks, craft tools, and survive the night.
                Every time I learned something new, that world seemed to grow a little bigger.
                I started to feel the joy of creating something with my own hands, even if it was just a small dirt shelter.
                Looking back, 2016 feels like the first doorway that opened for me - the place where I placed my very first blocks, and where my quiet love for Minecraft began to grow.
